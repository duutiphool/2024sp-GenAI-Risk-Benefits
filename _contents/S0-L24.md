### Towards Efficient Generative Large Language Model Serving: A Survey from Algorithms to Systems
+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15234
+ In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), generative large language models (LLMs) stand at the forefront, revolutionizing how we interact with our data. However, the computational intensity and memory consumption of deploying these models present substantial challenges in terms of serving efficiency, particularly in scenarios demanding low latency and high throughput. This survey addresses the imperative need for efficient LLM serving methodologies from a machine learning system (MLSys) research perspective, standing at the crux of advanced AI innovations and practical system optimizations. We provide in-depth analysis, covering a spectrum of solutions, ranging from cutting-edge algorithmic modifications to groundbreaking changes in system designs. The survey aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state and future directions in efficient LLM serving, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in overcoming the barriers of effective LLM deployment, thereby reshaping the future of AI.



### Pythia: A Suite for Analyzing Large Language Models Across Training and Scaling
+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373
+ How do large language models (LLMs) develop and evolve over the course of training? How do these patterns change as models scale? To answer these questions, we introduce \textit{Pythia}, a suite of 16 LLMs all trained on public data seen in the exact same order and ranging in size from 70M to 12B parameters. We provide public access to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16 models, alongside tools to download and reconstruct their exact training dataloaders for further study. We intend \textit{Pythia} to facilitate research in many areas, and we present several case studies including novel results in memorization, term frequency effects on few-shot performance, and reducing gender bias. We demonstrate that this highly controlled setup can be used to yield novel insights toward LLMs and their training dynamics. Trained models, analysis code, training code, and training data can be found at \url{this https URL}.




### MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training
+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611
+ Multimodal LLM Pre-training - provides a comprehensive overview of methods, analysis, and insights into multimodal LLM pre-training; studies different architecture components and finds that carefully mixing image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is key for state-of-the-art performance; it also proposes a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters that achieve SOTA in pre-training metrics and include properties such as enhanced in-context learning, multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.

### Sparks of Large Audio Models: A Survey and Outlook
+ Siddique Latif, Moazzam Shoukat, Fahad Shamshad, Muhammad Usama, Yi Ren, Heriberto Cuayáhuitl, Wenwu Wang, Xulong Zhang, Roberto Togneri, Erik Cambria, Björn W. Schuller
+ This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements and challenges in applying large language models to the field of audio signal processing. Audio processing, with its diverse signal representations and a wide range of sources--from human voices to musical instruments and environmental sounds--poses challenges distinct from those found in traditional Natural Language Processing scenarios. Nevertheless, \textit{Large Audio Models}, epitomized by transformer-based architectures, have shown marked efficacy in this sphere. By leveraging massive amount of data, these models have demonstrated prowess in a variety of audio tasks, spanning from Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-To-Speech to Music Generation, among others. Notably, recently these Foundational Audio Models, like SeamlessM4T, have started showing abilities to act as universal translators, supporting multiple speech tasks for up to 100 languages without any reliance on separate task-specific systems. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art methodologies regarding \textit{Foundational Large Audio Models}, their performance benchmarks, and their applicability to real-world scenarios. We also highlight current limitations and provide insights into potential future research directions in the realm of \textit{Large Audio Models} with the intent to spark further discussion, thereby fostering innovation in the next generation of audio-processing systems. Furthermore, to cope with the rapid development in this area, we will consistently update the relevant repository with relevant recent articles and their open-source implementations at this https URL.
